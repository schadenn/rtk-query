# Queries

This is the most basic feature of RTK Query. A query operation can be performed with any data fetching library of your choice, but the general recommendation is that you only use queries for requests that retrieve data. For anything that alters data on the server or will possibly invalidate the cache, you should use a [Mutation](./mutations).

By default, RTK Query ships with [`fetchBaseQuery`](../api/fetchBaseQuery), which is a lightweight [`fetch`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API) wrapper that automatically handles request headers and response parsing in a manner similar to common libraries like `axios`.

> Depending on your environment, you may need to polyfill `fetch` with `node-fetch` or `cross-fetch` if you choose to use `fetchBaseQuery` or `fetch` on it's own.

### Performing queries with React Hooks

If you're using React Hooks, RTK Query does a few additional things for you. The primary benefit is that you get a render-optimized hook that allows you to have 'background fetching' as well as derived booleans for convenience.

Hooks are automatically generated based on the name of the `endpoint` in the service definition. An endpoint field with `getPost: builder.query()` will generate a hook named `useGetPostQuery`.

#### Hook types

There are 3 query-related hooks:

1. `useQuery`

   - Composes `useQuerySubscription` and `useQueryState` and is the primary hook.

2. `useQuerySubscription`
   - Returns a `refetch` function and accepts all hook options
3. `useQueryState`
   - Returns the query state and accepts `skip` and `selectFromResult`

#### Query Hook Options

- [skip](./conditional-fetching) - Defaults to `false`
- [pollingInterval](./polling) - Defaults to `0` _(off)_
- [selectFromResult](#selecting-data-from-a-query-result) - Optional, allows you to return a subset of a query
- [refetchOnMountOrArgChange](../api/createApi#refetchonmountorargchange) - Defaults to `false`
- [refetchOnFocus](../api/createApi#refetchonfocus) - Defaults to `false`
- [refetchOnReconnect](../api/createApi#refetchonreconnect) - Defaults to `false`

> All `refetch`-related options will override the defaults you may have set in [createApi](../api/createApi)

#### Query Hook Return Types

```ts title="All returned elements"
// Base query state
status: 'uninitialized'|'pending'|'fulfilled'|'rejected'; // @deprecated - A string describing the query state
originalArgs?: unknown; // Arguments passed to the query
internalQueryArgs?: unknown;
data?: unknown; // Returned result if present
error?: unknown; // Error result if present
requestId?: string; // A string generated by RTK Query
endpoint?: string; // The name of the given endpoint for the query
startedTimeStamp?: number; // Timestamp for when the query was initiatied
fulfilledTimeStamp?: number; // Timestamp for when the query was completed

isUninitialized: false;// Query has not started yet.
isLoading: false; // Query is currently loading for the first time. No data yet.
isFetching: false; // Query is currently fetching, but might have data from an earlier request.
isSuccess: false; // Query has data from a successful load.
isError: false; // Query is currently in "error" state.

refetch: () => void; // A function to force refetch the query
```

Here is an example of a `PostDetail` component:

```ts title="Example"
export const PostDetail = ({ id }: { id: string }) => {
  const { data: post, isFetching, isLoading } = useGetPostQuery(id, {
    pollingInterval: 3000,
    refetchOnMountOrArgChange: true,
    skip: false,
  });

  if (isLoading) return <div>Loading...</div>;
  if (!post) return <div>Missing post!</div>;

  return (
    <div>
      {post.name} {isFetching ? '...refetching' : ''}
    </div>
  );
};
```

The way that this component is setup would have some nice traits:

1. It only shows 'Loading...' on the **initial load**

   - **Initial load** is defined as a query that is pending and does not have data in the cache

2. When the request is re-triggered by the polling interval, it will add '...refetching' to the post name
3. If a user closed this `PostDetail`, but then re-opened it within [the allowed time](../api/createApi#keepunuseddatafor), they would immediately be served a cached result and polling would resume with the previous behavior.

### Selecting data from a query result

Sometimes you may have a parent component that is subscribed to a query, and then in a child you may want to pick an item from that result without performing an additional query for a `getItemById` when you already have the result from a `getItems` query. `selectFromResult` allows you to select a specific segment from a result in a performant manner. When using `selectFromResult`, the hook will not rerender unless the underlying data of the selected item has changed and will ignore changes to other elements in a collection.

```ts title="Using selectFromResult to extract a single result"
function PostsList() {
  const { data: posts } = api.useGetPostsQuery();

  return (
    <div>
      <ul>
        {posts?.data?.map((post) => (
          <PostById id={post.id} />
        ))}
      </ul>
    </div>
  );
}

function PostById({ id }: { id: number }) {
  // Will select the post with the given id, and will only rerender if the given posts data changes
  const { post } = api.useGetPostsQuery(undefined, {
    selectFromResult: ({ data }) => ({ post: data?.find((post) => post.id === id) }),
  });

  return <li>{post?.name}</li>;
}
```

### Query Cache Keys

When you perform a query, RTK Query automatically serializes the request parameters and creates an internal `queryCacheKey` for the request. Any future request that produces the same `queryCacheKey` will be de-duped against the original, and will share updates if a `refetch` is trigged on the query from any subscribed component.

### Avoiding unnecessary requests

By default, if you add a component that makes the same query as an existing one, no request will be performed.

In some cases, you may want to skip this behavior and force a refetch - in that case, you can call `refetch` that is returned by the hook.

> If you're not using React Hooks, you can access `refetch` like this:
>
> ```ts
> const { status, data, error, refetch } = dispatch(pokemonApi.endpoints.getPokemon.initiate('bulbasaur'));
> ```

### Observing caching behavior

What you'll see below is this:

1. The first `Pokemon` component mounts and immediately fetches 'bulbasaur'
2. A second later, another `Pokemon` component is rendered with 'bulbasaur'

   - Notice that this one doesn't ever show 'Loading...' and no new network request happens? It's using the cache here.

3. A moment after that, a `Pokemon` component for 'pikachu' is added, and a new request happens.
4. When you click 'Refetch' of a particular pokemon type, it'll update all of them with one request.

:::note Try it out
Click the 'Add bulbasaur' button. You'll observe the same behavior described above until you click the 'Refetch' button on one of the components.
